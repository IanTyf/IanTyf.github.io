        What is this
      </div>
      <div class="bio">
        <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;Three Nights Survival is a social game that centers around deception and deduction. In a village of six players, two of them are werewolves. The werewolves have three nights to kill all the villagers, and if they fail, the villagers win. Every night each werewolf goes out for a kill individually. The villagers each have unique skills as well, but it is their decision making that ultimately determines if they can survive for three nights.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="separator">
        Why made this
      </div>
      <div class="bio">
        <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;I have always been a Werewolf fan. A huge fan. However, as much as I love the game, there are several designs and gameplay elements that I do not quite enjoy.
        </p>
        <br>
        <div style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%;">
          <p>
            1. The game requires at least 9 players to be balanced. While it is definitely playable with less, with ruleset like the original Mafia, the game is just not as intense and mind-bending as it should have been.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            2. If you die early, watching the rest of the game is very boring. This ties with the first point where the game should be played with a dozen people, which makes each session unbearably lengthy for those who get killed the first night.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            3. Normal villagers usually have worse gameplay experience due to the lack of information and room to make plays.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            4. The werewolves are forced to lie. The game is designed in such a way that you are punished for revealing your werewolf identity. This creates two issues. Firstly, it limits the variety of the gameplay. Every game becomes a detective game of who’s lying, and it becomes exponentially more boring when played with the same group of people over and over again. Secondly, it makes the game extremely intimidating to those who are bad at lying because it does not provide an alternate path to a werewolf victory without involving repeating ‘I am definitely not a werewolf, here is why’ ten times a game.
          </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;So I always had the idea of creating my own version of Werewolf. This year, with the influence of the global pandemic, my friends and I had to spend a lot of time on discord. Usually we would play Counter-Strike, which is a five-player game, but somehow we always, always, have six, and one person would have to be randomly thrown out and wait in pain. Therefore, I realized that it would be a perfect time to make a six-player Werewolf game that I always had in mind, and a discord bot would be a perfect narrator.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="separator">
        How was it made
      </div>
      <div class="bio">
        <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;limited to a six-player game, the power dynamic between the good guys and the bad guys need to be more complex. In Werewolf, as well as games like Among Us, if the number of bad guys remaining is not much less than the number of good guys remaining, then the bad guys almost always win. Before that, the bad guys need to hide their identity, which leads to forceful lying. To change this, the idea is to disconnect the werewolves, make it such that they act individually. While now they can kill two players per night in total, the inability to communicate for their kills turned out to be one of the most crucial parts of the game, as it has led to many emergent gameplay such as pretending to be delivering kill target info during day talk as a villager to avoid getting killed at night.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;It was also important to redesign the win condition for both sides. I wanted to preserve the joy of catching people lie, but also reduce the frustration of being completely fooled. For the good guys, they should not feel forced to spot all the werewolves. Instead, the goal is to survive for three nights. If any of the good guys are still alive after three nights, it is a team win. In this case, even those that are bad at deduction and spotting lies can still shine by strategically hiding their good guy identity to survive and clutch the game.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;Similarly, I also did not want the werewolves to feel forced to lie. The main reason it was the case in other games is because there is usually a voting process. So, to compensate the previous two nerfs to the werewolves, the village now does not vote out anyone at the end of each round. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;In terms of the identities, I chose the ones that have the most room for making plays. I believed that these special abilities should be exciting to play, and hopefully everyone can be happy with the identity they’re assigned to and are able to play them in their own style.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;The rest is all about coding the game as a discord bot and playtesting. My friends were all extremely supportive and provided tons of feedback. They helped tremendously with some of the balancing issues and challenged many of the design decisions that I made, which was incredibly valuable to me as I revised the rules and learned what I can do better.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="separator">
        What I've learned
      </div>
      <div class="bio">
        <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;Playtesting is everything! This was the first time I truly understood how playtesting can impact the game. On one hand, it helped with balancing issues that were subtle during the design process. But more importantly, through playtesting and asking for feedback I was able to know how it feels to play the game from different perspectives. Sitting down and designing a system can sometimes be very misleading especially when it comes to taking care of different types of players who approach the game differently. After a week of intense gameplay, almost one hundred game sessions, it was never clearer to me that the best way to make sure everyone can enjoy the game is by letting them play, without interfering, and then ask how they feel.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;It was also surprisingly difficult to process many of the feedback. Different players had different opinions in terms of how they would like to change the game. Most of the time they all made sense, but it occurred to me that it was really important to not just listen to all of the suggestions and apply them all to the game, but rather try to understand the essence of the problem and solve it rationally.
