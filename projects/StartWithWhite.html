        What is this
      </div>
      <div class="bio">
        <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;Start with White is a 2D single-player casual game. Players are shown with a target color at the beginning of each round for a limited amount of time. They then have to control a white circle to crash with other color circles that fly across the screen to blend with them. The goal is to reach a color that is as close to the original target color as possible within thirty seconds. The game involves short term memory, as players need to memorize the target color while they look for appropriate color to blend with. It also naturally consists of two phases: the player sets off to turn itself into a desired color, and once the player is satisfied with the current color, it becomes a game of dodging circles and maintaining that color all the way till the end.

        Why made this
      </div>
      <div class="bio">
        <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;This is a game made for Ludum Dare 45, an online game jam that took place twice every year. 
        </p>

        How was it made
      </div>
      <div class="bio">
        <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;The theme of the game jam was ‘start with nothing’. I did not want to go for a traditional route where a player character starts with either no money or no equipment since it was not quite interesting, and I also did not want to create a rogue-like game for time concerns. Eventually the idea is to interpret ‘nothing’ as ‘white’, and start from there.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;If there is a start, then should there also be an end? As a math student who just had Analysis class, I was very intrigued by the idea of limit. So the game should also have some sort of an ‘end’, and the goal is to try and get as close to it as possible. Combining with a ‘white’ start, the game then started to come together.
        </p>

        What I've learned
      </div>
      <div class="bio">
        <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;This was a great experience for me as I went through the entire process of designing and making a complete game under 48 hours. While the game is very simple, I had the opportunity to do all the design, drawings, programming, sound effects, and background music. Also, attending the jam itself opened my eyes to many of the other entries, games and ideas by other people off of the same theme. I still remember reading and writing comments during my Algorithm class. It felt amazing.
