        Numbers, Chips, And Lies. What Makes Poker So Special?
      </div>
      <div class="writingWrapper">
        <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;Poker is one of the most influential playing card games in the world. Due to its calculated ruleset design and the amazing synergy between a variety of mechanics, the game produces breathtaking gameplays. In a poker game, each and every decision matters hugely, making the game extremely intense and complicated as well as a great model for later card games and the strategy genre. The following analysis will mostly focus on three primary aspects of poker - mathematics, information, and psychology. These three elements together show how Poker is a precise, skill-based, and flexible game, and also emphasize its great influences on later games. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="subtitles">
          Mathematics
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Poker is a game of math. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;Traditionally, playing cards, which are numbered from 2-A with four suits, are most commonly used as a way of comparison. For example, in most trick-taking games, 5 is bigger than 2, and a certain suit is bigger than all others. They’re simple and easy to pick up, but such design loses the power of combinations between cards, which increases the complexity exponentially. Poker, on the other hand, making great use of both the suit and the numbers, has a tier list to represent the power of different combinations. It evolves from one-to-one card comparison to 5-to-5 comparison, which empowers pairs, cards of the same number, and flushes, cards of the same suit. For example, with A,A in hand and A,A,10,5,5 on table, we know that we’re guaranteed to win since we have the best four-of-a-kind, and only a straight flush/royal flush can beat us, but both are impossible. Another example would be to have a A,10 hand, and again A,A,10,5,5 on table. While we can form a powerful full house with A,A,A,10,10, we might lose to a player with a 5,5 hand, which yields a four-of-a-kind.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;In practice the game is way more complicated because of the special design that the dealer won’t show all common cards at once. Because of the inability for players to know their resulting 5-card combination before making any bets, the game produces some really fascinating and unintuitive math behind it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;For example, A,K unsuited vs A,Q unsuited. Both hands are great, but when matching up against each other before the flop, A,K has a dominant 74% win rate. However, if we match A,K unsuited against a pair of 2 unsuited, the winrate of A,K drops to only 48%, which is very low considering A,K is one of the largest hands and 2 is, on the other hand, the smallest card in the game. What if we now match 2,2 unsuited against K,K unsuited? It turns out that K,K has an unparalleled 82% chance to win this game.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;Such precise calculation that’s required for mid-to-high level play of poker is one of the reasons why people call it a smart people’s game. In contrast to earlier playing card games, where options arise and decisions are made all based on prior turn’s result, poker elevates the decision-making process from the very beginning when the player receives a hand. This mechanic combined with the complex math behind it is also seen in other playing card games, such as Contract Bridge. Contract Bridge perfectly showcases the feature of making decisions prior to making any actual moves, and it’s heavy emphasis on mathematics and precise calculation of hands is also very similar to the way poker is designed. 
        </p>

          Information
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;Poker is a game of information.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;Math equips a player the ability to tell how likely he could have a better hand against others. However, the chance of getting a hand that is straight up very advantageous is very unlikely. If a player only plays it safe, and decides that he/she will only call or raise the preflop if holding A,K, or any pairs better than or equal to 10,10, then it turns out that the probability of getting such a hand is only 4.7%. In other words, players need to find ways to win even when their hands are not that great. And this requires gathering information about other players’ cards.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;Naturally, the game does not allow players to communicate about their hands to avoid collaborations. However, poker gameplay actually reveals more information about players’ hands than it appears to be.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;One important source of information is players’ facial expressions. People often react to their cards by their facial expressions unconsciously, which makes it hard to intentionally control. Therefore, being able to read other people’s reactions when they check their cards is very crucial. Similar ideas are heavily implemented in other tabletop games, such as Werewolves, which mostly relies on spotting abnormal actions and facial expressions when someone is talking.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;The other important giveaway, and probably the most important one, is how a player has been betting. This is especially important in online poker, where players can’t see each other’s face. The design of poker betting aims to allow players to have a progressive idea of what others players might have. For every round of betting, each player will have at least one opportunity to raise the bet. When someone has a good hand, or forms a good combination at the particular round based on the card just revealed on the table, the player will likely raise the bet in order to increase the pot. Similarly, if a player has been checking, then it’s very likely that he/she is not very confident with the hand and is not willing to pay extra chips.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;As an example, if player A has K,J in hand and the flop is 10, 4, Q. It’s likely that he will check, in which case another player, player B, who holds 10, K, will know that A either has nothing, or maybe a pair of 4, or sometimes a pair of 10, but definitely not a pair of Q, since otherwise he would not check. So player B might decide to raise the bet for just a bit in case of a pair of K somewhere out there, and player A decides to call for a chance of getting a straight. Then the next round, which reveals a J, player A sees the pair of J, and decides to raise the bet. Now from player B’s perspective, since A did not bet anything last round, it’s very likely that he benefits from this J, either as a pair of J or some sort of straight (8,9,10,J,Q or 9, 10, J, Q, K, but probably not 10,J,Q,K,A since a A,K hand would be too good to not bet earlier), in which case both possibilities beats player B’s pair of 10. So he might decide to fold accordingly.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;Therefore, the rounds of betting is a very significant mechanic that adds a lot more layers of thinking between each round. It enables players to adjust their strategies and make decisions not only based on the newly revealed card(s) on table, but also by their adjusted estimation of cards that other players may have. This design is commonly seen in the strategy game genre, where mid round decisions are usually not only reactive but also proactive. In other words, most decisions are based on both consequences and the player's own observations. An example would be Hearthstone, where a player makes decisions based on the newly drawn card as well as his/her updated understanding of the opponent’s deck/strategy based on the previous turn.

          Psychology
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;Poker is also a game of psychology.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;From the very beginning of the history of player cards, one of the most natural games that gets developed is a guessing game. Because the cards all have an identical back side, it’s very tempting for someone to just put a card down and ask someone else: what is this card? or, this is a queen of hearts, do you believe me? Such fun resides in the elementary excitement of guessing and getting surprised by, and is well utilized in fields like card magic and card games. Poker is not an exception.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;If people can gather information from others by reading their actions and facial expressions, then it’s natural for some good players to fake their reactions and even their decisions in betting to purposefully reveal misleading information. Such technique is called bluffing, and it’s very commonly seen in any level of poker games. Therefore, the game becomes a mental game. He’s going for an all-in - do I believe him? Or, he checked this round, so he must not have anything good, but was that intentional? Such thoughts occur in almost every player’s mind every single round before every decision is made. They are extremely important questions  because if they are answered wrong, the impact could be so huge that one could call an all-in and fail, which loses him/her the entire game.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;So in some sense, the psychological aspect of poker is one of its most significant features. Even with the great amount of mathematics and information involved, due to the potential of bluffing, poker games almost never have one best decision on the table. Players will have to constantly adjust their strategies (i.e. not bluffing every round) and try to adjust to other players’ strategies as well. This is what separates most normal players to professional players, who are able to put together all information as well as only showing information that they intend to give away.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;But one issue that arises from such design is that someone who does not play the game seriously, and does crazy moves like all-in every round, is almost game-breaking. They would fundamentally break other players’ experience and make their effort meaningless. As a result, the game is almost always played with chips, which are actual money. When people play with some virtual representation of assets, it’s inherently easier for them to make abnormal and unreasonable moves, because why wouldn’t they. However, in games where real money is on the line, people almost always play more seriously not only because they don’t want to lose money, but also because they want to earn from others. This also makes the game more addicting because of the gambling element in betting real money and guessing, which makes it extremely popular in casinos.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;In conclusion, Poker is truly a complex game. The way players have to keep track of all elements including precise calculation, information gathering, and bluffing, is what makes the game so wildly popular and influential. It’s mechanics like betting and sequential revealing of cards enables intense interactions between players and is therefore implemented and imitated by modern tabletop games as well as video games that heavily rely on decision-makings.
