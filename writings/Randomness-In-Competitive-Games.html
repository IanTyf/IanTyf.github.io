        Randomness In Competitive Games
      </div>
      <div class="writingWrapper">
        <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;Randomness is a vague word. It can mean things that take place in no particular pattern, or events that have unpredictable results, or moments where we just have no clue what is going to happen at all. Similarly, randomness in games can also represent a lot of things. It varies from genre to genre and from game to game. So instead of trying to take a glance at each genre and come up with an irresponsible summary of the findings, this paper will focus on one particular type of game: competitive games. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;In more casual games, randomness can easily bring a lot of fun. For example, for a simple 1v1 clicker game, adding ‘miss’ and ‘critical hit’ easily creates many interesting consequences and clutch moments; for rogue-like games, random dungeons and item drops make the game much more replayable; even for narrative games, random events and unpredictable NPC responses can make the storyline more dynamic. In other words, from a design perspective, adding some randomness into non-competitive games is almost always quite safe, and most of the time makes the game more exciting to play.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;But competitive games are different. For games which people compete on a professional level, fairness is the number one rule. Neither the players nor the audiences want to see a professional League of Legends game decided by one critical hit, or a basketball game where for each basket, there’s a 30% chance that it counts for 3 points and a 20% chance that it doesn’t count. Therefore, randomness in those games are much harder to implement, and different games do it in various styles. In particular, the two games, Poker and StarCraft II, both being extremely competitive on the highest level, interpret and incorporate the concept of randomness very differently.

          Poker
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;Randomness is at the heart of Poker. Being a card game, Poker perfectly takes advantage of the design of playing cards. In a Poker game, each player receives a random hand of two cards from a 52-card deck, and the winner is decided by whoever has the largest 5-card combination from his/her hand and the five common cards on the table. From a player’s perspective, for each round the hand is totally random, the hands of the opponents are totally random, and the five common cards, which are revealed in a 3-1-1 sequence, are totally random. In other words, almost every Poker game is completely random, and the players will have to do everything they can to win in a totally random setup.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;So if the game is so uncertain, how come it is played at a competitive level? Wouldn’t rookie players still have a shot against many of the professionals? It turns out that the randomness in Poker is what makes it extremely fascinating and enjoyable to play. And this is mainly due to its incorporation of betting.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;While each round the winner is decided by hands, the winner of an entire poker game is decided on whoever has the most amount of chips. Since each round has a big blind and a small blind, which are essentially bets that players will have to make before the round starts, the game prevents players from folding every round until they get an extremely good hand. In other words, the game is less about who is the luckiest and draws the most amount of best hands, but more about how to maximize the value of each hand. Therefore, instead of laying back and letting randomness be in charge, players start to think of ways to conquer the randomness. They would study the chances mathematically, take advantage of the randomness in the form of bluffing, and overcome it by gathering information and making decisions accordingly.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;Firstly, people study the chances intensively. While each round the hand dealt is completely random, players prepare for this randomness by understanding the value of each hand. Since the rule of Poker is fixed, a power ranking of all possible hands can be easily calculated, so that when a player gets a hand, he/she will have a rough understanding of what the chance of winning might be. Because of this, a player is able to make decisions very easily despite the random element in drawing cards. If a hand is very small, such as 2,5 non-suited, the player can easily fold the hand early on without losing a significant amount of chips.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;On the other hand, if a player gets a good hand, then randomness takes into effect again. From a player’s perspective, his/her hand is no longer random, but the opponents' hands are still uncertain. While a hand can be a solid two-pair, what if one opponent has a straight? Since there can only be one winner each round, the question becomes how can a player know if his/her hand is big enough. Once again, this is solved by the idea of winning most chips instead of winning most hands. If a player gets an extremely good hand, in order to maximize the value, the player will need to earn as many chips as he/she can in this round. To do this, the player needs to place big enough bets so that when other players call, the chips pile up and eventually goes to the player, assuming that he/she does have the best hand. In the process of doing this, it reveals information about the player’s hand. From other players’ perspective, someone that bets a significant amount equates to the person having a very good hand. This is then the opportunity to make a rational decision and weakens the impact of randomness by playing safe.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;Going a little further, the randomness and the uncertainty of other players’ cards yield a strategy called bluffing. Players can strategically place bets that make other players believe that he/she has a good hand, which is not necessarily the case. The uncertainty then evolves from “what cards does he have” to “does he really have what his bet says”. In other words, players can turn the randomness in Poker into their advantage.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;Lastly, the randomness in Poker creates memorable moments. It is one thing to win a game, but it’s even more valuable if the game played out in some unforgettable ways. The last two common cards are revealed one by one, which means that in an all-in situation, where both players’ hands are open to the public, even though one player has a clear advantage given the first four common cards, the final card, the ‘river’, might just turn the tide around. This kind of randomness is pure luck, which happens so rare that it does not influence the overall game that much, but leaves a great moment for everyone to remember. 
        </p>

          StarCraft II
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;StarCraft II is almost the complete opposite of Poker in terms of how randomness is implemented. It is a Real-Time Strategy game, which requires the game to be overwhelmingly balanced. The maps have to be totally symmetric, and the armies and structures need to be balanced across all races. Therefore, most of the game elements have to be definitive. If a player wants a unit to perform one action, it needs to perform it in the same way as it would for a thousand times; if one player builds two Zerglings and the other player builds an Immortal, then the two Zerglings must never win the fight against the solo Immortal. This is the exact opposite of Poker, where the only unchanged thing is the rule. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;There are mainly two things in StarCraft II that are considered to be random in a traditional sense. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;Firstly, a player may select ‘Random’ as the race, which means that going into a match, the player won’t know what race he/she will play until the match actually starts. While this is definitely randomness, it is not quite interesting since it’s a conscious decision of the player choosing to play in such a random style. Especially on the professional level, there are rarely any professional players playing with random race. Even on StarCraft II ladder, among the top 50 players in North America, there is only one person playing with random race.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;Secondly, StarCraft II used to have maps that are symmetrical both horizontally and vertically. Since the maps are all squares, it is designed in a way that each player might spawn in one of the four corners of the map. With the ‘fog of war’ implemented, this means that as a match starts, the player will have no knowledge of where the opponent spawns, and thus have to send out units around the map for scouting purposes. This was widely considered to be the most random element in StarCraft II, but unfortunately, this feature has been removed from the game. Now the players will always spawn at one of the two definitive spawning positions, which are symmetrical. This totally removes the randomness and both players will have a clear understanding of where the opponent resides.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;The reason why this change happened is unclear. But one suspicion has to do with balancing. StarCraft II is a game about strategies. In particular, players like to refer to strategies as ‘builds’, or ‘build orders’, which essentially represents the game plan coming into the match. Naturally, there are different styles. Some are more progression focused, called ‘macro centural’, but some are more fast-paced. However, in the old random-spawn setup, if a player wants to go for a fast-paced build that intends to end the game before the five minute mark, what could happen is that if the two players spawn very close to each other, then this build is incredibly strong. But if the two players spawn on the diagonal corners, then the build is delayed by travel time and therefore is not as effective as it could have been. In other words, there are games where the winner is decided not by the players’ skills and preparations, but by luck, which is not good for a competitive game.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;So is there really no interesting randomness in StarCraft II? The answer is no, if we look at randomness from a different angle. As mentioned at the beginning, randomness can mean many different things. If we consider randomness as something that a player is uncertain about and can happen in unpredictable ways, then StarCraft II is all of a sudden full of randomness.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;The idea is to again focus on the concept of ‘builds’. In a RTS game like StarCraft II, strategies are extremely important. But they’re also like ‘rock-paper-scissors’. Since the game is balanced, there is no build that is flawless. Some builds are more aggressive, but maybe it is weak against air units since it does not have units with good anti-air attacks. Some builds are more late-game focused, but it might get interrupted along the way by some early attacks from the opponent. Along with the fog of war, this means that coming into a match, players will have to make a decision, which is what build to execute, before getting any information on what the opponent is going for. This uncertainty, the fact that anything can happen on the other side of the map, is the real randomness in StarCraft II that every player has to face in every single match.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;But it wouldn’t be very competitive if it’s as simple as rock-paper-scissors. A simple solution to this uncertainty is scouting. Players will send units across the map to the base of the opponent to see what structures and units are built. This is all of a sudden extremely similar to Poker: the idea of getting information to overcome the uncertainty that the game brings. In Poker, a player knows his/her own hand, but needs to know other players’ hands. In StarCraft II, a player knows what strategy he/she is going for, but needs to know the opponent's strategy to better prepare for it. On high level gameplay of StarCraft II, scouting is almost the most important thing in a match, since poor scouting might result in losing the game by getting attacked with unexpected units at unexpected timings. Therefore, what makes this even similar to Poker is how it also has the idea of bluffing, but only exists in the top level of professional gameplay. One example is a recent match between two zerg players. Zerg is known for its potential to go for early game aggression, so it's important to scout whether the opposing zerg is trying to do so. A common way to scout is to see if the zerg is building a second hatchery, which is a sign of a more peaceful early game since building a hatchery is resource intensive. However, in a recent match, a professional player called ‘Scarlett’ went for a build that builds a hatchery to give her opponent a sense of safety, and then immediately went for all-in aggression to catch the opponent off guard. Because her opponent thought she would play the longer game, he built mostly workers instead of army units which makes him impossible to defend the all-in from Scarlett.

          &emsp;&emsp;Poker and StarCraft II are two typical examples of competitive games from two different genres that incorporate randomness in completely different ways. In Poker, randomness exists everywhere in the gameplay, and players work with randomness into their own advantage. In StarCraft II, randomness is less traditional, but still exists in the form of uncertainty of what the opponent is potentially doing. The ways players of both games respond to the randomness are surprisingly similar, which both involves gathering information about the situation to overcome the randomness. That is to say, randomness in both games shape the gameplay of these games, which makes it an essential concept even in these competitive, fair-centric games.
